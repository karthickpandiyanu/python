Object Oriented Programing
--------------------------

Class NameOfClass(): #Object are also called as class, First letter capital, Camel case

	def__init__(self, par1, par2): create as instance for the object
		self.parm
		self.parm2
		
	def some_mmethod(self):
		#functions
		print(self.param1)
		
Class is blue print, 

	class Dog():
		
		def __init__(self, mybreed) #creating __init__ means create instance for the object and self keyword is used to point the variable for that, Constrctor for class, self 
		
		self.breed = mybreed
		pass - doesnt do anything just passes
		my_dog = Dog()
		my_sample = Sample()
		type(my_sample) - __Main__ .Sample
